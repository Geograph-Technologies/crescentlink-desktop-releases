    <description>In this release, licensing has been changed from computer based to user based allowing users to sign in to CrescentLink with a pre-assigned GEOGRAPH account. The CrescentLink code base now targets .Net 4.7.2 (461808), and Project Planner and Network Manager extensions have been merged into one extension named CrescentLink.
